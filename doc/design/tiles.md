The game is composed of tilesets. These are graphic images divided into
different terrain types. Each tile can be reused within a larger map to
create realistic and complicated terrains.

Each element of the map is a window into the tileset.

Hex elements are preferred for wargames because they give a more balanced
movement that the use of squares.

Finding a tile set is proving tricky but it looks like a non-trivial
exercise to create one from scratch. Bugger. Still, needs must when the
devil rides. Necessity is the mother of invention...you get the picture.
