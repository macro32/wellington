The background to this effort started in the 1970's, when I was a student.
We played tabletop games for whole weekends. Mainly American Civil War.
And the armoured conflicts of the Eastern Front during WWII. With a few 
others chucked in for good measure.

The games were turn based. Orders had to be written. The orders had to be
sent and received and took time for the recipient to react. Just like in
real life. You had to understand the terrain and capabilties of the troops.
You were also subject to random effects. A message may not be received. A
unit may break at a bad time. And so on.

There was no micromanagement. No having to worry about every unit. You gave
orders and stuff happened. And you controlled and reacted as necessary. But
you also had to cover the bases. And anticipate likely action. Be decisive.

I have long wanted to try and recreate that feeling that gaming on the table
top had.

The rules we played were from the War Games Research Group. I still have the
hard copy of their tank rules Armour and Infantry 1925-1950 we used for the
1:300 scale models that refought Kursk.

Two classic books that should be read by anyone with any sort of
power in business, politics, and not just military, are On War and The Art of
War. 

The musket and cannon era is the easiest to automate. Movements were more
restricted. Firepower was limited. 

Some more recent references which might prove timely and useful.

A company what does hex map based games including one on the Peninsular War. Got
to put an order in to sample the game play.

The tile editor tiled seems to be free and simple and worth trying.

http://www.mapeditor.org

And here is a tutorial on using it.

And another free editor. A bit more work but it might run under Mono.

It definitely looks like the tile based map is the way to go. Makes sense. A good tutorial
introduction can be found here.

Written in a nauseating style but it might be worth a look.
