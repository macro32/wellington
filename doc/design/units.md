The following is a top level view of the main commanders and units involved in the
Peninsular War campaign.

Units are actors and exist as stand-alone objects. These will be implemented as 
Active Objects in the first instance. This is a well-known pattern to give objects
their own thread of execution and seperate invocation from execution. I can see that
it would be good to give each actor independance as much as possible. This will
permit that. Whether it is strictly useful to decouple the call from execution, time
will tell.
