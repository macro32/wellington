==========

A Napoleonic War simulation with emphasis on accuracy. 

A no-nonsense war game simulator that will not use flashy graphics but will try to create a realistic simulation of a Napoleonic army with a
minimum of management.

It uses the C++ Boost libraries as much as possible. This is a deliberate design decision.

It also makes use of C++11 features where they are appropriate.
