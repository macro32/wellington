A Napoleonic War simulation with emphasis on accuracy. 

A no-nonsense war game simulator that will not use flashy graphics but will try to create a realistic simulation of a Napoleonic army with a
minimum of management.

It uses the C++ Boost libraries as much as possible. This is a deliberate design decision.

It also makes use of C++11 features where they are appropriate.

The thing that annoys me most about many simulations and war games is the amount of micro management that has to be done.
This requires a lot of jumping around and real time coordination which is really not a realistic simulation of a war game. If
you are in command then you should issue commands and let your unit commanders do the management. I want the game to operate like
this. Less exciting maybe but more realistic. The challenge is to make the AI unit commanders behave realistically. It 
would be nice for them to have some personality. An initial implementation can take the rules used in table top gaming and 
implement them.
